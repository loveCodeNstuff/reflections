How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Ability to see the differences and narrow down when the bug was introduced to code base.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can revert a change you made if needed at any time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You will commit when a feature or new item is done.  That way its not half way updated on git commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Easier to control then doing it the way Google Docs does it

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows all the commits ever and git diff shows the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can easily go back and revert a commit if you mess up your code.  Nothing is lost.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Any project that I have to iterate over time with many changes along the way.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

  You can break it and not worrying because you can always revert back to the working commit.
